To compile the project, use command: 'g++ -std=c++11 project.cpp camera.cpp rtw_stb_image.cpp -o project' which creates an executable project

My final scene should be ready to render, just execute: './project teapot.obj'

You could substitute the teapot for any of my object files, but they all render in different size
and positions so the user has to set the scene properly

When I added the stb_image library, my makefile broke. I continually said I was going to fix it
but I ran out of time.s
